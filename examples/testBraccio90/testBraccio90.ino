  testBraccio90.ino

 testBraccio90 is a setup sketch to check the alignment of all the servo motors
 This is the first sketch you need to run on Braccio
 When you start this sketch Braccio will be positioned perpendicular to the base
 If you can't see the Braccio in this exact position you need to realign the servo motor positions
